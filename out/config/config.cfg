#This is a config file for the game.
#DO NOT put comments after values, the option will not get parsed properly (will work on it tho).
#You can shuffle them though, or even remove options,
#the program doesn't care as long as they have a defined default.
#For possible bindings, please refer to config.md.
#You can put indentation in the form of tabs and spaces
#in between ':' and values, so options can be nicely grouped together.
#If you want you can also indent the whole line.
