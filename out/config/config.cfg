#This is a config file for the game.
#DO NOT change stuff on the left of a ':' or put comments after values, the game will not load.
#You can shuffle them though, the program doesn't care.
#For possible bindings, please refer to config.md.
#You can put indentation in the form of tabs and spaces
#in between ':' and values, so options can be nicely grouped together.
