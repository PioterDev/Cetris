# Game in C

Welcome to my repository, here you will find
a pretty (terrible) implementation of the game "Tetris".

To see features, see FEATURES.md.

As of I'm writing this, I treat it as a learning opportunity
for subjects like computer graphics, multithreading and
game development, not only as "something I have to do for a grade".
